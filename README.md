# GIMMIE YT

**"borrow" music and video from YouTube**

## About

`gimmieyt` is a simple PYQT application that makes it easy to 'borrow' files directly from YouTube

I have no idea whether it is legally allowed, so use at your own risk. I'm just writing the code

And please, please, don't sue me YT :)

## Use

The UI is clear and intuitive, no instructions required.

## Installing

For now, 'installing' is only available through cloning the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Adamocho/gimmyt.git ~/gimmyt
```
